      content: `Welcome to Day Seven.

You've made it here—not just through information, but through transformation.

Today, we don't add more. Today… we become.

Everything you've remembered, reclaimed, and reignited is now ready to take root.

This is where the field becomes not just something you feel… but something you live.

What does coherence feel like in you right now?

Take a moment. Close your eyes if you'd like. Scan your breath… your spine… your field…

Is it warm? Still? Expansive? Focused? Just notice.`

      title: "What Coherence Really Is",
      content: `Coherence isn't about feeling perfect. It's not always peaceful or easy.

It's about being in agreement with yourself.

Where your breath, your nervous system, your intention, and your energy… are all saying the same thing.

When you live in coherence, your field becomes a signal. Not a reaction. Not a question. But a broadcast.

And the world begins to organize around you.`
    },
    {
      title: "Field-Based Sovereignty",
      content: `Now the question becomes: Who governs this field?

Who decides what you allow? Who moves your breath? Who directs your frequency?

This is where we enter the realm of true sovereignty.

Sovereignty means: "I am not under anyone's control."

It's the declaration that you are not owned. Not by systems. Not by entities. Not by conditioning. Not by programs.

Sovereignty is a clearing. A liberation. A return to Source alignment.

But you can be sovereign—and still not be autonomous.`
    },
    {
      title: "Understanding Autonomy",
      content: `Autonomy means: "I govern myself."

No one else is making my choices—not externally, and not energetically.

This is not about rebellion. It's not about being separate. It's about being centered. Rooted.

Autonomy is the activation that comes after sovereignty.

It's what happens when the flame becomes not just a light… but a command signal.

Autonomy is a field that says:
"I know what I know."
"I walk by my own resonance."
"I carry my Source authority—through every step, word, and silence."
"I don't ask if I'm ready—I decide that I am."`
