      content: `Welcome to Day Four. By now, you've remembered what the aura is… you've felt how to sense it… you've learned how to ignite your own field.

Today, we begin to attune—to the larger symphony of energies that live within you and around you. Because your aura isn't just personal. It is part of a much bigger song.

When Source light enters the realm of embodiment, it doesn't stay singular. It fractals. It refracts. It splits into a spectrum of tones, frequencies, colors, and archetypes—just like white light through a prism.

Your body is a prism. Your aura is the living display of how well that light is moving through you.`,

      content: `Each chakra is not just a spinning wheel of energy. It is a planetary gateway. A place where cosmic tones meet the human instrument.

Today, we re-map what you may already know—not as abstract colors or shapes—but as living planetary currents you can feel, name, and embody.`,
