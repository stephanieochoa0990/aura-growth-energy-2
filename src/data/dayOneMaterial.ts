      subtitle: "You were never disconnected. You were just distracted.",
      content: `Welcome.
You made it here.
Not just to this class… but to a turning point in your journey.
A moment where your inner knowing said:
"I'm ready to remember."

Because this class isn't about learning something new.
It's about remembering what has always been within you.

Whatever brought you here — it wasn't random.
It was a response from your field.
Because your aura — your biofield — is always listening.
It's not separate from you.
It is you.

You don't "have" an aura.
You are an aura.

Before you had bones…
Before your blood started flowing…
Before your heart started beating…
You were energy.
You were blueprint.
You were frequency in formation.

Your aura is your first body.
It is the intelligent pattern that forms the physical — not the other way around.
It is your interface with Source… and the template of your sovereignty.
And every part of it… is alive.

So why don't most people know this?
Because over generations, we've been taught to forget.
Not just through neglect — but through deliberate distraction.

The systems around us hijacked our:
• Attention — keeping us overstimulated and externally focused
• Language — stripping us of the words to describe the subtle
• Perception — dulling the senses that once felt the unseen

And yet… this wisdom is not lost.
It's in our bones.
It's in our dreams.
It's been guarded in sacred lineages all over the world.

In Kemet (ancient Egypt), the aura was encoded in the lightbody teachings of the Ka and Ba.
In the Vedic traditions, the energy body was mapped in the koshas and pranic sheathes.
The Essenes, mystics of the early Hebrew world, taught how the body and spirit were woven through light.

Many of these traditions held one key truth in common:
The human being is not a flesh-and-bone machine.
It is a living instrument of light.
And the aura — the biofield — is how we play the instrument.

This class isn't about stacking new systems on top of you.
It's not about turning you into someone else.
It's about peeling back the noise and helping you remember the natural architecture of who you already are.

This isn't about learning more.
It's about remembering deeper.

Because the field has always been here.
It's just been waiting for your awareness to return.

So take a breath with me now.
Inhale through the nose…
Exhale gently through the mouth…

You don't have to force anything.
You don't have to protect or prove anything.

You are not broken.
You are bioelectric.
And your field… is alive.

Let's remember what it means to be a living field of light.`

      content: `Now that we've remembered the existence of the aura…
Let's explore what it actually is.

Because the aura — or biofield — isn't just symbolic.
It's scientific.
And once you understand its design, everything else in this class will start to click.

Magneto-Electric Flow
At the root of your being is a magneto-electric current.
This is not the same thing as a machine-generated electromagnetic field.

Magneto-electric means your field is:
• Living
• Responsive
• Self-sustaining
• Created by breath, movement, emotion, and thought

It's the dance of charge and coherence.
You're not just a signal — you are the conductor.

Your Heart Is Magnetic
Your heart is the most magnetic organ in your body.
Its field is estimated to be 5,000 times stronger than your brain's electrical output.

Every time your heart beats, it sends out a magnetic pulse that radiates through your body — and several feet beyond it.

This pulse is emotional, intuitive, and relational.
It changes based on how you feel.
It syncs with others when you're in harmony.
It gets jagged when you're in fear or suppression.

So when you feel a wave of peace around someone…
Or tension before a word is even spoken…
You're reading their magnetic broadcast — and they're reading yours.

Your heart field is how your body speaks to the world.

Scalar Fields: The Heart's Nonlinear Language
Now here's where it gets even deeper.
When your magnetic heart field meets the electric currents in your body —
something else emerges:
a scalar field.

Scalar waves are different from what most people think of as "energy."
They are:
• Spiral-shaped
• Nonlinear
• Non-decaying
• Capable of storing memory and intention
• Able to pass through matter and space without weakening

They don't move from point A to B like traditional waves.
Instead, they create a standing wave — a kind of vibrational atmosphere around and within you.

When your heart is coherent — when breath, emotion, and focus are aligned —
you become a scalar generator.

This is the true language of your field.
Not words. Not even thoughts.
But resonance.

That's why you can:
• Think of someone and feel them respond
• Sense someone's presence before they speak
• Feel the "truth" of a message deep in your cells
• Heal across distance with focused breath`
