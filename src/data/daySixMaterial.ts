      title: "What Integration Means",
      content: `Welcome to Day 6. Take a deep breath… and let it go.

You've made it here, not just by completing five days of class — but by walking yourself through your own remembering. Through thresholds. Through mirrors. Through fire. Through stillness.

This is the day where all of that work doesn't just echo around you — it becomes you.

This is Integration.

Let's pause and feel into that word — not with your mind, but with your field.

Integration means something is no longer separate. Not just intellectually, but energetically.

Integration is what happens when the pieces of you that were once scattered, shamed, numbed, hidden, or rejected — are no longer being held at a distance.

It's when you stop being the one managing everything — and become the one embodying it all.`

      title: "The True Meaning of Wholeness",
      content: `It's when your nervous system finally exhales.
When your voice no longer trembles.
When your center is no longer a performance… but a home.

It's when you no longer have to pretend to be okay. Because you actually are.

Not because everything is perfect. But because you are intact.

And this is the true meaning of wholeness.

You don't get there by fixing every piece. You get there by allowing the signal of you to be strong enough… for the pieces to return.

We've done the clearing. We've done the sensing. We've done the commanding. Now we seal it.

Not with walls. Not with effort. But with presence.`

      title: "Anchoring Your Essence",
      content: `Today is about anchoring:
• Anchoring all your energetic parts back into this moment
• Anchoring your soul across timelines
• Anchoring the masculine and feminine aspects of your essence into harmony
• Anchoring your nervous system into the safety of your flame
• Anchoring your field as a single radiant signal — not a splintered broadcast

We will move slowly today. Deliberately.

Because integration is not an act of doing — it is an act of being.

It is an allowing. A synthesis. A soft exhale after a deep reclaiming.

Today, you do not need to push for insight. You do not need to earn your coherence.

Today, we remember that your flame is steady. Your voice is real. Your center is clear.

And from here… everything else aligns.`

      title: "Fragmentation and Retrieval",
      content: `Now that you've arrived fully into the energy of this day… let's begin by bringing light to the places that haven't yet arrived.

Because even when we feel ready — even when we feel open — there can still be pieces of us lingering just outside the room. Watching. Waiting. Unsure if they're allowed back in.

That's what fragmentation is. And it's more common than we realize.

It doesn't mean you're broken. It means you adapted — to pain, to pressure, to impossible choices.

Fragmentation happens when we had to leave a part of ourselves behind in order to keep going.`
