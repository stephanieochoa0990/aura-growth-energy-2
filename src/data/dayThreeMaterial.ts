      content: `Welcome back. Today we begin the journey of inhabiting.
Not just understanding the aura… but becoming it.
Not just sensing the field… but living inside it.

Let's begin by remembering something vital:
Your aura is not something outside of you.
It is you, extended.
It is your inner state made visible.
It is your breath, your rhythm, your memories, your power—radiating into space.

Your body is not a prison.
It is a bridge.`,

      content: `Throughout life—especially during trauma, heartbreak, or deep programming—
we sometimes learn to split.
To separate from the parts of us that were in pain…
or from parts that carried power we didn't feel safe holding.

These fragmented aspects don't disappear.
They just… wait.
Sometimes in the past.
Sometimes in a memory.
Sometimes in a relationship.
Sometimes in another person's field.

When you feel scattered, indecisive, or deeply tired…
it might be because you're not all here.`,
