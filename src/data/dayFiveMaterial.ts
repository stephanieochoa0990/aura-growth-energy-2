      content: `Command doesn't come from force. It comes from coherence. It comes from a field that's so clear, reality begins to reorganize around it.

Most of us were taught that command means control, dominance, or speaking with volume and authority. But in the biofield, that's not what true command looks like. The more you try to control from the mind, the more you'll find your field loses signal.

Real command doesn't come from the head—it comes from the field.`,
      keyPoints: [
        "Command is the natural effect of a coherent field",
        "When aligned, you become the organizing signal",
        "Strong signals pull scattered environments into resonance",
        "Your field can be the stable center that distortion can't penetrate"

      title: "The Three Pillars of True Command",
      content: `Your command starts with knowing who you are before you speak. It's built on three foundations:

**Clarity** – Know what you're really transmitting. When your energy, body, and words all match, your field becomes stable and powerful.

**Containment** – Hold your current. Stop leaking emotion, chasing validation, or scanning for approval. Containment means you hold yourself.

**Coherence** – Stay sourced. When your field is clear, you're not influenced by chaos outside you because you've harmonized what's inside.`,

      title: "The Language of the Field",
      content: `Before you speak, your field already said it. Your presence shapes outcomes before words are exchanged.

Your field constantly broadcasts your nervous system state, internal congruence, belief in what you're saying, and your level of alignment. This isn't mystical—it's biology, magnetism, and attention working together.

People instantly pick up on whether you're grounded or anxious, whether you believe yourself, and whether you're broadcasting authentic signal or rehearsed script.`,
